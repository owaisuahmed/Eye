# Eye
Eye Exercise Repository for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in using the mouse movement event to move shapes that look like eyes. The eyes will appear to be following the mouse pointer.

Usage: Download/copy the HTML, JS, and CSS files in this repository to a local folder. Open index.html and you should see something like the following:
<br/>
<img src="./eyes.png" />

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding features that will center the eyes if the mouse pointer has not been moved for more than ten seconds. A more advanced version could manipulate the shapes to give the effect of eyes blinking every ten seconds or so.
